      Documentation to Accompany July 1, 1999 Population 
              Estimates for States by Age and Sex

The U.S. Census Bureau released these population estimates to the public in
March, 2000. The estimates incorporate revisions of estimates from previous
years as well as the results of special censuses and test censuses conducted
by the Census Bureau.

Age - The age of individuals is age at their last birthday.
                                                  
Census Regions and Divisions - The Census Bureau delineates two sets of
sub-national regions that are formed of states.  This two-tiered system of
regions consists of 9 census divisions nested within 4 census regions.  The
Northeast region includes the New England division: Connecticut, Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont; and the Middle
Atlantic division: New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.  The Midwest
region includes the East North Central division: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan,
Ohio, and Wisconsin; and the West North Central division: Iowa, Kansas,
Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota.  The South
region includes the South Atlantic division: Delaware, District of Columbia,
Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West
Virginia; the East South Central division: Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and
Tennessee; and the West South Central division: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
and Texas.  The West region includes the Mountain division: Arizona, Colorado,
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming; and the Pacific
division: Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington.

Median Age - The median age divides the age distribution into two equal parts;
half of the cases fall below the median value and half are above the median
value.

4/1/90  - is an estimate of the 1990 population for governmental units with
boundaries reported as legally effective as of January 1, 1998.  This includes
annexations, new incorporations, mergers, et cetera.

7/1/90 through 7/1/99 -  The estimated population is the computed number of
persons living in an area (resident population) as of July 1.  The estimated
population is calculated from a demographic components of change model that
incorporates information on natural change (births minus deaths) and net
migration (net domestic migration and net movement from abroad) that has
occurred in the area since the reference date, such as April 1, 1990, the date
of the 1990 census.  Additional information on the methodology used to produce
these population estimates is contained in Current Population Reports P25-1127
and at our Internet site:  <http://www.census.gov/population/www/method.html>.

Resident Population - These population estimates are for the resident
population.  The resident population of an area includes all residents (both
civilian and Armed Forces populations) living in the area.  The geographic
universe for the resident population is the 50 states and the District of
Columbia.  It excludes Puerto Rico and outlying areas under United States
jurisdiction.  The resident population excludes U.S. citizens residing abroad.

Sex - These statistics provide population estimates for males, females, and
the total population.
